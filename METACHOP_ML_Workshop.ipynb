    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook presents an example of a machine learning analysis pipeline from start to finish. It was written to be paired with the ML 102 Workshop presented in collaboration with IBI and LDI. Please note that this notebook is meant to present an accessible example, but does not necessarily include the optimal strategies to analyze the target dataset examined herein. Identifying the the optimal analysis pipeling steps/components is one of the fundamental challenges of data science.  This is almost never known ahead of time when seeking to tackle a new dataset/anlaysis. The pipeline presented below could be reproduced using different software or coding languages.  We have opted to utilize Python and the Jupyter notebook framework here due to is accessibility, flexibility, and prevalence in the ML community. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this workshop this notebook is primarily meant to be viewed as an html link (pre-run) as a reference/resource/example.  This avoids the many possible complications related to installing python, the necessary packages, understanding how to use/run jupyter notebooks, etc.  However, both the html and original jupyter notebook file are available for those who wish to try out the notebooks themselves.  However explaining how to code in python or the logistics of how to run this notebook interactively are beyond the intended scope of the workshop itself. \n",

    "3. A secondary data dictionary file is available that describes the features and includes the header values\n",

    "### Deal with Missing Data\n",
    "The first challenge in dealing with missing data is to understand the nature of the [missingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data). Values in a data set can be (1) missing completely at random (MCAR), (2) missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR). \n",
    "\n",
    "Many downstream machine learning algorithms and respective implementations are not designed to accomodate the presence of missing value in a dataset (e.g. the popular Python ML package, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), does not allow missing values). Generally there are four main approaches to handle missing data: (1) imputaton - values are added in the place of missing data using one of many proposed strategies, (2) omission - instances and/or features with missing data values are discarded from further analysis, (3) in cases where missingness is not or may not be MCAR, a new varibable can be constructed (i.e. feature construction) that describes if a value was missing or not (i.e. asks the question, is missingness itself informative?), and (4) analysis - by directly applying downstream methods that are unaffected by missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For the purposes of this analysis we will assume that the missing data is MCAR.  Since we will be using skikit-learn to complete our downstream modeling, we can not leave missing values in the dataset. Furthermore, because there is not a particularly large number of instances or features in our data we will avoid ommitting either. Therefore in this analysis we have opted to impute the missing values with a common simple approach, i.e. we will apply **'median-value imputation'** to real-valued features, and **'mode-value imputation'** to discrete features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any employed imputation method is essentially making an 'educated guess' that may be introducing bias.  I recommend that analysis be completed directly using methods that treat missing data 'neutrally' or ignore it, whenever possible. \n"

    "Feature processing is all about improving the representation of data so that downstream machine learning can achieve higher performance. Feature processing can include any of the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Feature Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) - New features are custom-built from existing features using domain knowledge. The goal is to provide downstream algorithms features that are more accessible for a machine to train on. (E.g. taking start and stop dates, that an algorithm would struggle to make sense of, and engineer a feature that captures the time duration between these dates. Feature engineering is typically completed manually using domain expertise. \n",
    "* [Feature Transformation](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-feature-transformation-in-machine-learning) - Application of 'algorithms' to create new features from existing ones. \n",
    "    * [Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) - Mathematically [normalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics) features to fall within a given range or [transformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics) by a given function (e.g. log transformation).  Scaling can be an important preprocessing step for interpreting the output of statistical modeling analysis (e.g. linear regression). Typically scaling is less important for machine learning (there are exceptions). \n",
    "    * [Binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning) - converting continuous/real valued features to discrete or categorical features.\n",
    "    * [Dimensionality Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) - Also known as feature extraction or feature projection. Applies an algorithm designed to reduce the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables, typically via some projection strategy (e.g. [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)).\n",
    "    * [Feature Construction](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Feature-Construction-Methods-%3A-A-Survey-Sondhi/1faf80be961715c763bfab82d577e2a86ae65a9a) - Can be viewed as a more 'automated' approach to feature engineering, where a computational methods combines 2 or more existing features, or even the output of some other machine learning model to 'construct' a new feature.\n",
    "* [Feature Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) - The process of identifying a subset of 'relevant' and sometimes 'non-redundant' features to pass on to modeling.  Ideally feature selection will preserve all relevant features and eliminate all irrelevant or completely redundant features (however this is non-trivial). Three families of feature selection algorithms are typically described: filter-based methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Notably, filter-based feature selection algorithms also serve as feature-weighting algorithms that can be employed as part of the exploratory analysis to assess which features are most likely to be informative. \n",
    "    * When applying filter-based feature selection it is generally up to the data scientist to decide how many variables to select, and how many to remove.  In datasets with very large numbers of features, it is usually a practical necessity to reduce the feature space as much as possible.  Different feature selection methods may offer some guidelines for when there is no evidence that a given feature is relevant (and thus may be removed from consideration). However, one must be aware of the inherant limitations of a given feature selection method before deciding whether to remove a feature, based on the goals or scope of the desired analysis (e.g. just because a feature selection method that can detect univariate associations suggests that a feature is irrelvant may not mean that a method that can take complex associations into account may identify it as being relevant). \n",
    "\n",
    "These components of an analysis pipeline are typically very problem/domain dependant, but are also tied to the modeling methods that plan to be utilized downstream (i.e. machine learning or traditional statistical modeling). In this notebook we will just demonstrate feature selection, as our dataset is relatively small (only 49 features), and our features do not require any obvious feature engineering or tranformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In particular, here we will try applying two different approaches: (1) [Mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) an information theorgy approach for identifying features with a univariate association with outcome, (2) [ReliefF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_(feature_selection) a filter-based feature selection algorithm that is uniquely able to indentify features with univariate associations as well as complex multivariate interactions that are predictive of outcome.

    "## Method Selection\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb it is typically best practice to run a number of machine learning algorithms in modeling (i.e. at least 2-3), and ideally those methods should have differen strengths and weaknesses.  This is due to the [no-free-lunch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem) that essentially suggests that no one method can perform ideally in all circumstances.  Therefore, when we are faced with the analysis of some new dataset there is no way to know the optimal strategy to apply ahead of time. Sometimes simple analysis methods can work optimally (as well as run quickly with interpretable results), however other times much more complicated methods are required that may have different trade-offs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis/notebook we have decided to focus on two machine learning modeling approaches: (1) [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), and (2) [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest). We have selected decision trees because the are an easier to understand and an intuitive ML modeling approach.  Further, the models produced by these systems are easy to interpret and apply. However decision trees are often suseptible to bias, and even minor instance sampling differences in the training set can alter the trained model, impacting model generalizability and reproducibility. As a secondary method, we focus on random forests, which are essentially a methodological extension of the decision tree concept. Random forests are one of the best known and most widely applied ML algorithms.  They introduce the concept of an ensemble, training a large group of trees to collectively constitute a predition model.  This allows these methods to be more robust to bias, obtain better generalization capability, and are still easily and quickly trained. However, random forests are inherently more difficult to interpret than a decision tree, and (like decision trees) struggle to model complex interactions in data particularly when the number of features gets to be large. \n",

    "## Hyperparameter Sweep\n",
    "Most any ML method has 'hyper' or 'run' parameters that the user can tune/adjust, modifying how the algorithm functions. The process of tweaking and optimizing these parameters to improve ML performance is known as [hyperparameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization). A hyperparameter sweep mostly commonly includes idenifying which algorithm parameters are known to, or are likely to, impact performance on a given dataset, and then varying the setting of these one or more paramters in separate runs of the algorithm.  This step is not only important for squeezing the maximum performance out of ML methods, but also in fairly compairing the performance of different ML methods on given datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of necessity, almost all ML algorithms have default hyperparameters specified (related to [default arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_argument). First and foremost, default parameters are specified so that the algorithm is able to run even if the user forgets to specify these hyperparamters. They are often set with the intention of testing out the method on a 'toy' or demonstration dataset included with the software, or they are set as simple, accessible placeholders to ensure that the first time a user runs the software it runs smoothly and quickly. However default parameters are certainly not guarenteed (if even likely) to lead to optimal ML performance on a given dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and basic hyperparameter sweep strategies include a [grid search](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/an-introduction-to-grid-search-ff57adcc0998) or a [random search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_search), but other more sophisticated searches are also employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with many other things in ML, there is no absolute right way to perform a hyperparameter sweep. One could easily waste a large amount of computational time on an exhaustive serach of hyperparameter settings and combinations without improving performance much, or at all. However some degree of hyperparameter searching outside of using the default hyperparameter settings is considered essential to ML best practices. "
